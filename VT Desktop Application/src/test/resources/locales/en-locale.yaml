      Students will use this file to solve your task. Write the necessary imports,
      add comments and call some functions in the 'run' method
      (we will hide it from the students during the solution).
  test-solution-file-template:

      You can use this file to test your task. Write the necessary imports,
      add comments and call some functions in the 'run' method.

      Visualization folder
    description: |
      Use this folder to store your visualization files (additional components, visualization settings and so on).
      All these files are automatically imported into all solution files. So if you use a different folder, you'll have 
      to define all imports yourself.
  wrappers-read-me-file:

      Wrappers folder
    description: |
      Use this folder to store wrapper files (classes and functions that wrap the learning classes and functions 
      and additionally call visualisation methods). All these files are automatically imported into all solution files. 
      So if you use a different folder, you will have to define all imports yourself.
  informational-read-me-file:
    title: |
      Informational folder
    description: |
      Use this folder as storage for information files (general task description, study content or task terms). 
      The application only supports .html and .md files, so bear this in mind!

      Override this panel the way you want it. It will be used for visualisation.
  visualization-scene-panel-template:
    general-swing-comment: |
      Use this class to customize your panel as a component (setting styles and adding internal components). 
      To access the JPanel component (we'll pass an instance of your CustomPanel to the constructor),
      use the 'panel' variable.
    general-java-fx-comment: |
      Use this class to customize your panel as a component (setting styles and adding internal components). 
      To access the JFXPanel component (we'll pass an instance of your CustomPanel to the constructor),
      override the 'configureScene' method using 'scene' variable.
    button-flags-comment: |
      Use this method to configure the visualisation control buttons (you can disable some of them 
      if you don't have an implementation for these actions).

      annotation-comment: |
        Define in this annotation the name of the class you are wrapping. This way the student
        can use the normal language syntax, but your wrapper classes will be called. If the 
        class does not perform the wrapper functionality, simply delete the annotation.
      visualization-action-registration-comment: |
        To bind your code and the visualization scene, register the visualization action in 
        the code when it is to be executed. Use this method to do it:
